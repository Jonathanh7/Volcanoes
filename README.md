## Project 4

## Title: Volcanic Escapades

## Description:

- Vocanic Escapades is a travel research blog regarding Volcanoes worldwide. It's meant to inspire travelers to visit these reachable and adventureous natural volcanoes. While most people cannot climb k2 or Mount Everest. Volcanoes can be hiked instead of climbed, while giving the same altitudes of accomplishment. Volcano tourism is for all types of travelers, and is absolutely stunning.
- The blog will have descriptions and images of each volcano as well as the location. These will make up the MVP portion of the project.
- A React front end with a Ruby on Rails back end will be utilized on this.

## MVP Goals:

- Users create accounts
- Users can favorite blog posts
- User can upload Volcanoes

## Post MVP:

- Will be to incorporate Google maps to have a pinpoint of each volcano on each blog post.
- Skyscanner's api on adding a flights functionality with each volcano so the user can have a click away access to purchasing flights to said destination.

- Along with getting the Rails routes working, and the correct controllers with Crud.

## Time Frame estimates

- Authentication: 2 days
- The rest of Rails, 1 day
- React: 2 days
- CSS: 1 day
